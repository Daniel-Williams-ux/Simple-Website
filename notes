ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : ......
Change 'Mark' to your own name
Change the hobbies to match yours
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Mark</p>
<p>I like <b>boxing</b> and <i>fishing</i></p>
Add more lines of text to tell people more about you (favorite music / anime, achievements etc). The sky's the limit!
Use Bold and italic text to highlight important stuff.
Add some of these as other ways to present your text:
<h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> for other header variants
<small> for smaller text
<u> to underline text
<mark> to highlight text
<del> to cross over words
<sub> and <sup> to render text as subscript / super script
Let's summarize
<h1> is a first level heading that is used for big, bold text that you want to stand out (like a title) and <p> tags are used for paragraphs.
The letter inside the tag often implies what the tag does (<b> for bold, <i> for italic). Read more about tags on the W3 schools doc.
Almost all tags in HTML have opening and closing pairs: <<h1></h1>, <p></p>, <b></b>.

1. Add this line to the end of your code:
<img src="mark.png">
You should see Mark's face popping out. (Yes, at Replit we call this little guy Mark)

2. Remember, the words inside "" here must be the same name you gave to your file in the file tree.
<img src="mark.png">
3. Add a description of the image using alt and add width and height.
<img src="mark.png" alt="an image of mark" width="640" height="240">
4. You have a working website already! Share it with others. Click the URL in the webview header and copy and share it with people.


1. Create links with <a> tag, which stands for "anchor"

<a href="https://replit.com">this is a link to the replit site</a>
The most important stuff is the attribute href, it defines what link should this text take us.

href = hypertext reference

-- Amjad Masad, CEO man

Challenge #1: Nesting Stuff
Achieve something like this, only a part of line is link

when you click that blue text it should take you to that web page

Nest <a> inside a <p>

<p>Here's my favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrus_orthocanna">fish</a></p>
Challenge #2: Image as Link
Anything can be a link! Observe how we used <a> above to nest a piece of text inside, see if you can figure out how to make it so that clicking on an image takes you to a link.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwXbp9bLlY"><img src="mark.png"></a>
can you tell if this is a link?

History: First Webpage Ever
Fun fact, we can already recreate the first web page ever with what we've learned.

ou can safely say your HTML knowledge is on par with Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he created the World Wide Web.

But really, we've already grasped the core of the internet: Links! It's just a giant web with information linking to other information.

Challenge #3: A Simple Linktree Site
A lot of people just use services like Linktree for their personal website, we already learned how to do this ourselves!

Try make a simple site where it just lists some links to your works, your interests or your internet presence elsewhere.

Challenge #4: Multiple Pages
Now that we have the ability to link to other sites, try make a website with multiple pages that contains links to one another!

Let's summarize:
Create a link using <a> tag.

The attribute href (hypertext reference) defines what link the text will send to. This is where you add the website link.

Don't forget to add https:// when adding the website link.

The code between > </a> is the text that will appear on your webpage.

Turn an <img into a link by adding the <a href= tag at the start.

Next, let's spice up your website with audio/video and different types of text.
